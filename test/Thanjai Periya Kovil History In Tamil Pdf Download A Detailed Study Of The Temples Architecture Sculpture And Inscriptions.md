The construction of the temple began in 1003 CE and was completed in 1010 CE. It took seven years and thousands of workers, artisans, and engineers to build this masterpiece. The temple was built with granite stones that were brought from distant quarries. The stones were carved and fitted together without any mortar or cement. The temple has a towering vimana (pyramidal tower) that rises to a height of 66 meters (216 feet), making it one of the tallest temples in India. The vimana is topped by a massive stone dome that weighs about 80 tons. The dome was lifted and placed on the top of the vimana by using an ingenious ramp system that was built around the tower.
