How to Apply a Preset to Your Source
  
After adding your source to the queue, you need to apply a preset to it. A preset is a set of encoding settings that determines the output format, quality, and size of your encoded file. Media Encoder comes with many built-in presets for various platforms and devices, such as YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Apple TV, Roku, and more. You can also create and save your own custom presets if you have specific requirements or preferences.
  
To apply a preset to your source, follow these steps:

1. Select your source in the queue.
2. In the Preset Browser panel, browse and select the preset that matches your desired output. You can use the search bar or the categories to find the preset you need.
3. Drag and drop the preset onto your source in the queue. Alternatively, you can double-click on the preset to apply it.
4. You can preview the output settings of your preset in the Output column of the queue. You can also click on the preset name to open the Export Settings dialog box, where you can modify or customize the settings if needed.

How to Change the Output Name or Location
  
By default, Media Encoder will save your encoded file in the same location as your source file, with the same name and a different extension based on the preset. However, you might want to change the output name or location for better organization or convenience. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select your source in the queue.
2. In the Output column of the queue, click on the output name to open a Save As dialog box.
3. Choose a new name and location for your output file. You can also create a new folder if needed.
4. Click Save to confirm your changes.

How to Start Encoding Your Source
  
Once you have added your source, applied a preset, and changed the output name or location if needed, you are ready to start encoding your source. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select your source in the queue. You can select multiple sources if you want to encode them at once.
2. Click on the Start Queue button at the top right corner of the queue panel. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl+Enter on your keyboard.
3. Media Encoder will start encoding your source and show you the progress and status in the Encoding panel. You can pause, resume, or cancel the encoding process at any time by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
4. When the encoding is finished, Media Encoder will show you a green check mark next to your source in the queue. You can also hear a sound notification if you have enabled it in the Preferences.
5. You can review your encoded file by clicking on the output name in the queue. This will open your default media player and play your file. You can also right-click on the output name and choose Reveal Output File to open its location in File Explorer.
