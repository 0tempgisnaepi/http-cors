## How to Use Your Cem Due Mig Welder
 
Before you start welding with your Cem Due Mig Welder, you need to make sure that you have the following items:
 
- A suitable power source (220V or 380V)
- A gas cylinder with the appropriate gas mixture (argon or argon + carbon dioxide)
- A welding torch with the correct nozzle and contact tip
- A welding wire spool with the appropriate diameter and material
- A ground clamp and cable
- Personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, helmet, goggles, etc.

Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps to set up and use your Cem Due Mig Welder:

1. Connect the power cable of the welder to the power source and turn on the main switch.
2. Connect the gas cylinder to the gas regulator and adjust the gas flow rate according to the welding wire diameter and material.
3. Connect the welding torch to the positive terminal of the welder and the ground clamp to the negative terminal.
4. Insert the welding wire spool into the wire feeder and thread the wire through the guide rollers, tension spring, and torch liner until it reaches the contact tip.
5. Select the welding process (GMAW or FCAW), wire feed speed, and voltage according to the welding parameters table in the Cem Due Mig Welder Manual.
6. Put on your PPE and make sure that the workpiece is clean and free of rust, paint, oil, etc.
7. Attach the ground clamp to the workpiece or a nearby metal surface.
8. Squeeze the trigger of the torch to start welding. Keep a steady distance between the nozzle and the workpiece (about 10-15 mm) and move the torch along the joint at a consistent speed.
9. Release the trigger of the torch to stop welding. Turn off the gas valve and wait for a few seconds before disconnecting the torch and ground clamp.
10. Turn off the main switch of the welder and disconnect it from the power source.
